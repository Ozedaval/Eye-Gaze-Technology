<h2><a name = "Title1"> 1. Project Overview </a></h2>

* According to the World Health Organization, roughly 15% of the world's population live with some form of disability. There is a technology that helps people with disabilities to communicate better in life. The major barrier however in accessing this technology is its high cost that most people cannot afford. To promote the inclusivity of this technology, we are seeking to recreate this technology to leverage the smartphone platform.

  The Eye Gaze technology has been widely used to capture eye movement and in turn control the screen display without physical interaction. Commercial products which use Eye gaze technology are usually  expensive. This project seeks for possible solutions to make eye gaze technology more affordable.
